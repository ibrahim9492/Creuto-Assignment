# Book Management App

A simple web application for managing a personal book. This app allows users to add, edit, delete, search, and manage books by categorizing them into unfinished and finished lists.

## Features

- **Add New Book**: Add a new book with its title, author, and completion status.
- **Edit Book**: Update the details of an existing book.
- **Delete Book**: Remove a book from the list.
- **Search Book**: Quickly find books by their title.
- **Change Completion Status**: Move books between unfinished and finished lists.

### Book Lists
The app organizes books into two separate lists:
1. **Unfinished Book List**: Contains books that are still being read.
2. **Finished Book List**: Contains books that have been completed.

Books are added to the appropriate list based on the `book.isComplete` property:
- If the "Is Complete" checkbox is checked in the form, the book is added to the **Finished Book List**.
- Otherwise, it is added to the **Unfinished Book List**.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure and content of the application.
- **CSS**: Custom styling for the application.
- **Bootstrap**: Responsive design and prebuilt components.
- **JavaScript**: Core logic and functionality.

## Planned Updates

- **SweetAlert Integration**:
  - Add stylish alerts and dialogs for better user experience.
  - Provide confirmation prompts when deleting books.

- **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) or Anime.js**:
  - Implement smooth animations for adding, updating, and deleting books.

- **Enhanced Book Properties**:
  - Add a "Pages" property to store the total number of pages in a book.
  - Update UI to display and manage the "Pages" property.

## How to Use
